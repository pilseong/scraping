You can work around this with the two following methods. Secondary div Add another div element to the container to hold the background. This is the most cross-browser friendly method and will work even on IE6. HTML <div class="myDiv">
    <div class="bg"></div>
    Hi there
</div> CSS .myDiv {
    position: relative;
    z-index: 1;
}

.myDiv .bg {
    position: absolute;
    z-index: -1;
    top: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    background: url(test.jpg) center center;
    opacity: .4;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
} See test case on jsFiddle :before and ::before pseudo-element Another trick is to use the CSS 2.1 :before or CSS 3 ::before pseudo-elements. :before pseudo-element is supported in IE from version 8, while the ::before pseudo-element is not supported at all. This will hopefully be rectified in version 10. HTML <div class="myDiv">
    Hi there
</div> CSS .myDiv {
    position: relative;
    z-index: 1;
}

.myDiv:before {
    content: "";
    position: absolute;
    z-index: -1;
    top: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    background: url(test.jpg) center center;
    opacity: .4;
} Additional notes Due to the behavior of z-index you will have to set a z-index for the container as well as a negative z-index for the background image.
